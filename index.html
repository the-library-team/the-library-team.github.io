            <p>The Library’s main goal is and always will be preservation and accessibility. Some novels and novellas have already been translated and published officially in English by Square Enix or others. As these are already being preserved and are accessible they are left out of The Library, and instead a link to purchase them is present on their page. All contents on this site are subject to change based on the availability of the product in the future. If content is released or made accessible officially in English in the future, it may be removed from The Library. Thank you for understanding.</p>
